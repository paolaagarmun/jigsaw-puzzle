11/2:
1. Select one div
    1.1 Save that div index and position (we can have an index 1 on position 0)
    => this.index gives me the real index of the puzzle piece


    !Idea:
    Set ifClicked = true when event listener happens
    set them all to false at the beginning
    set a max selection of two

    Completed:
    1. Created variable that stores the index and the position of the first clicked puzzle piece
    2. Assign red border

2. Select second div

    Completed:
    1. Created variable that stores the index and the position of the second clicked puzzle piece
    2. Assign green border

3. Switch the position of the first and second clicked puzzle pieces
    Roadblock: impostor syndrome bc I ended up copying how to do it

    Completed:
    1. Switching functionality

11/3:
4. Remove the red border conditionally (check out pizza builder lab for inspo)
    - add a class to all the divs created
    - remove the class after switch happens

    Completed:
    - only assign red border to first clicked puzzle piece

    To-do:
    - reset back to no borders after switch

5. Set winning scenario
    I have the array index and position
    Completed:
    1. winning alert
